<h2>Encounter Builder Instructions</h2>
<p>
	Pick the budget you want to assign to each monster type.
	Setting a monster budget to 'all' will disable the monsters
	below it. 'None' will remove that monster group from the
	results. 'More', 'Half' and 'less' represents the amount of
	remaining budget that will be used on that monster group.
</p>
<p>
	For each group, you can independently select whether you
	would like the group to contain ranged or caster monsters,
	select will give results for both. The more constraints are
	applied the more likely the search will fail. If that
	happens, remove some restraints and try again.
